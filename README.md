# DP Visualizer

**Step-by-step Dynamic Programming animations, built with vanilla JavaScript.**

Watch the DP table fill in real time, follow along with synchronized Python 3 code highlighting, and explore nine classic problems — all in a zero-dependency, zero-build-step web app.

## Features

- **9 DP problems** spanning four categories — Grid, Linear, String, and Knapsack
- **Step-by-step playback** with Play, Pause, Step, and Reset controls
- **Adjustable speed** via a live slider (0.5× – 2×), takes effect mid-playback
- **Synchronized Python 3 code panel** — the exact line being executed is highlighted as each cell fills
- **Time and space complexity badges** displayed per problem
- **Randomized inputs on every run** — grids, house values, strings, and amounts are freshly generated; the Example panel updates to match
- **↺ New Example button** after completion — reruns with a different random input
- **Light and Dark themes** with automatic persistence via `localStorage`
- **Resizable split pane** — drag the divider to give more space to the grid or the code panel
- **Axis labels** on the DP table (row/column indices, character labels for LCS, weight labels for Knapsack)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Space` play/pause, `→` step, `R` reset, `T` toggle theme
- **Animated cell entry** with staggered transitions when a new grid loads
- **No build step, no dependencies, no installation** — open `index.html` and it runs

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Laxmidhar9823/Dynamic-Programming-visualizer.git
cd Dynamic-Programming-visualizer
```

Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser — or use VS Code's Live Server extension for auto-reload during development. No `npm install`, no compilation, no config.

## Architecture

The app is organized into three layers. Problem solvers are completely isolated from the visualizer — adding a new algorithm never touches playback logic.

**Data flow for a single run:**

1. User selects a problem and presses **Start**
2. `main.js` reads the input fields, generates random data where applicable, and calls the problem solver
3. The solver runs the full DP algorithm and returns `{ result, steps }` — `steps` is a pre-computed array of `{ i, j, val, type, line }` records, one per cell write
4. `main.js` calls `initVisualizer({ steps, gridSize, code, answer, axisLabels, complexity })`
5. `visualizer.js` builds the grid DOM, renders axis labels, and starts a `setInterval` loop
6. Each tick: one step is consumed → the matching cell gets a CSS class (`start`, `visited`, `processing`, `end`) → the corresponding Python code line is highlighted

**Adding a new problem takes four steps:**

1. Create `js/problems/yourProblem.js` — export a function returning `{ result, steps }`
2. Add an `<option>` to the `<select>` in `index.html`
3. Add a `case` in `main.js` to call your solver and pass the result to `initVisualizer`
4. Add an entry to `INPUT_CONFIG` (if the problem has configurable dimensions) and `COMPLEXITY`
